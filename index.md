# Computational Spintronics Group

Created in 2002 the Computational Spintronic Group, headed by Prof. Stefano Sanvito, is one of the world leading research groups in theoretical materials science. The team comprises about 20 researchers, including PhD students and postdoctoral scientists, and is active in various aspects of materials and nano-devices science. In particular the group both develops new computational techniques and applies them to current topical problems in materials/devices science. We maintain a strong network of international collaborators and we are supported by National and International funding bodies. As part of our activity we provide materials solutions for industry, which can access our research program through a number of funding vehicles. See our research page for more information.


```{note}
We develop new computational techniques for materials/devices science. We help companies to design new materials platform for emerging technologies and academic groups to model their experiments.
