Prof. Sanvito's research group engages heavily in computational research, and as a result has to maintain a moderately large High performance computational (HPC) infrastructure.

It is managed by group members with help from Trinity Research IT.

Following are the list of systems we have, and should serve as a guide for group members.

## Boyle

## Lanczos

## Network Storage
